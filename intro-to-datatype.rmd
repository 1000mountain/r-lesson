## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
1+2+4
```
```{r}
experiment1 <- read.csv(file="data/experiment.csv")
```

```{r}
experiment1$protein_names
experiment1$intensity + 1.
paste("Protein name:", experiment1$protein_names)

```
```{r}
experiment2 <- experiment1
experiment2$protein_names <- paste("Protein Name:", experiment2$protein_names)
```

```{r}
experiment1$protein_names + experiment1$intensity

```
```{r}
c(1,2,'f')
```
```{r}
list(1, 2, 'f', TRUE)
List_example <- list(title="Numbers", numbers=c(1,2,4),data_exsit=TRUE)
```
```{r}
fruits <- c("apple","pear","orange")
factor_f <- factor(fruits)
```

```{r}
mydata <- c("case","control","case","control")
factor_mydata <- factor(mydata, levels= c("control","case"))
```

```{r}
replicate <- c(1,2,1)
experiment <- cbind(experiment, replicate)
```

```{r}
levels(experiment$protein_names) <- c(levels(experiment$protein_names),"FOXO3")
new_protein <- list(protein_names = "Foxo3",
                    intensity = 1.5,
                    in_membrane =0,
                    replicate = 2
                    )
rbind(experiment,new_protein)
```

```{r}
experiment[,-2]
```

```{r}
another_colume <- c(1,2,3)
cbind(experiment, another_colume)

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
